//  The FrameSource component provides an abstraction layer for different sources of video frames,
//  such as camera feeds, video files, or image sequences. This protocol-based design enables
//  the YOLO model to process frames regardless of their origin, maintaining a consistent
//  pipeline from frame acquisition to model inference and result visualization. The protocol
//  defines essential methods for starting and stopping frame delivery, and delegates for
//  receiving frames and performance metrics.
